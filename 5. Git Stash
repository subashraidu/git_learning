Git Stash --> Git command that temporarily saves (stashes) your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) so you can work on something else without committing them.

Stash your changes
git stash

To include untracked files too:
git stash -u

View stashes
git stash list

Apply the latest stash -- Your stash is reapplied, but it stays in the list.
git stash apply

Apply and remove from stash -- Reapplies and deletes from stash list.
git stash pop

Drop a stash manually
git stash drop stash@{0}

Clear all stashes
git stash clear

Example Workflow

# Youâ€™re coding on feature branch
git status
# shows modified files

# Need to switch to main branch quickly
git stash          # saves your changes
git checkout main  # now branch is clean

# Later, return to feature branch
git checkout feature
git stash pop      # get your changes back
