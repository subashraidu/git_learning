git diff --> shows the difference between two states of your repository.
By default, it compares working directory changes vs the staging area (index).
You can also compare staged changes, commits, or branches.

View Unstaged Changes: Shows changes in your working directory that havenâ€™t been staged
git diff

Workflow  :
You edited deploy.sh but want to verify before staging. (Confirms only the intended config change is there)
git diff deploy.sh

View Staged Changes: Shows differences between the staging area and the last commit.
git diff --staged

Compare Between Commits
git diff commit1 commit2

Compare Branches
git diff main feature-branch

Compare Against Remote Branch
git fetch origin
git diff main origin/main
