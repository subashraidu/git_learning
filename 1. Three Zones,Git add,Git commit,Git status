# Think of Git as having three zones:

Working Directory → where you make changes.
Staging Area → a temporary holding area for changes you want to commit.
Repository (.git) → permanent history (committed files).

The staging area lets you prepare and review changes before committing.
It’s like a “shopping cart” where you collect items before checkout

git add  --> Moves changes from Working Directory → Staging Area.
Now Git knows you want this change included in the next commit.

git add <file>
git add .     # adds all modified files


git commit --> Moves changes from Staging Area → Repository (saved in history).
Now the change is permanently recorded in Git history.

git commit -m "Your message here"


git statu --> Shows what’s happening in your repo
Which files are modified
Which files are staged for commit
Which files are untracked (not yet in Git)

git status


workflow example

# Step 1: Check status
git status

# Step 2: Stage changes
git add app.py

# Step 3: Commit changes
git commit -m "Fixed bug in login logic"

# Step 4: Verify
git status   # should say 'nothing to commit'
