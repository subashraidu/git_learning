# What is a Branch in Git?

A branch is simply a pointer to a commit in Git history.
By default, every Git repo starts with a branch named master or main.
Branches allow you to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase.

1. List all branches
git branch

example: 
* main
  feature-1

2. Create a new branch
git branch feature-1
This creates a new branch named feature-1 at the current commit.
But it does not switch to it — you’ll still be on your old branch.

3. Switch to an existing branch
git checkout feature-1
Moves you from main → feature-1.

4. Delete a branch
git branch -d feature-1

5. Create + switch in one step
git checkout -b feature-2
reates a new branch feature-2 and immediately switches to it.

6. Switch to an existing branch (new command)
git switch feature-1
git switch -c feature-3
Same as git checkout -b feature-3, but clearer.

Workflow Example

# Start on main
git branch
# * main

# Create new branch
git branch feature-1

# Switch to it
git switch feature-1
# or: git checkout feature-1

# Verify
git branch
# main
# * feature-1
