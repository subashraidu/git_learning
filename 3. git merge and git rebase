Git Merge --> Combine changes from one branch into another.
Creates a new commit (merge commit) that ties both branches together.

git checkout main
git merge feature


Git Rebase --> Move or “replay” commits from one branch on top of another.
Instead of a merge commit, Git rewrites history so it looks like your branch was developed after the latest changes from the base branch.

git checkout feature
git rebase main

# Rule of Thumb for DevOps/Team Work:
Use merge in shared/public branches (safe).
Use rebase on your personal/local feature branch (clean history).
